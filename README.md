# OS-EX-1-Assembling-the-System---CASE-STUDY

## AIM:
To assemble the computer system.
## MATERIALS REQUIRED:
1.Central Processing Unit (CPU)
2.Motherboard
3.Memory (RAM)
4.Storage (Hard Drive or SSD)
5.Power Supply Unit (PSU)
6.Graphics Card (if not using integrated graphics)
7.Optical Drive (optional)
8.Computer Case
9.Input Devices (keyboard, mouse)
10.Monitor
11.Cables (SATA, power, data, etc.)

## PROCEDURE:
### Prepare Your Workspace:

1.Find a clean, well-lit area with sufficient space to work comfortably.
2.Use an anti-static wristband to ground yourself, or touch a grounded metal object frequently to discharge any static electricity to avoid damaging sensitive components. 2.Install the processor (CPU):
3.Open the CPU socket on the motherboard.
4.Carefully insert the CPU, aligning the notches or markers.
5.Apply thermal paste if necessary (some CPU coolers come with pre-applied paste).
6.Attach the CPU cooler following the manufacturer's instructions.
